About the project. 
It was started on the 26th of Febuary 2024 apart of my colleges game jam. There was no theme choosen so I decided to do a lumberjack simulator - kinda sorta thing. 

Apart of the challenge I choose to do it with minimal internet (restricting myself to 2 searches per 5 hours) and to do it with OOP - something id not used more then the basic animal class to show a friend in around 7 months.
The development was a fun time of guessing, bug testing and hair pulling fustration because of my lack of internet. I think its made be a better programmer and I think its turned out very good.
